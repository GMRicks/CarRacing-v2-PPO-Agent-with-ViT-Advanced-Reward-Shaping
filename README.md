# CarRacing-v2-PPO-Agent-with-ViT-Advanced-Reward-Shaping
This project implements an advanced PPO agent for CarRacing-v2 using multi-frame stacking and a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for robust feature extraction. It employs sophisticated reward shaping to discourage off-track behavior and provides real-time visual feedback, pushing the limits of continuous control.
